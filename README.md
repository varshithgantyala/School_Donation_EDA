# School Donation Analysis: An Exploratory Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing information about school donations from DonorsChoose.org. The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns and insights related to donation amounts, project types, school locations, and funding times.

## Key Questions & Findings
This analysis addresses several key questions, including:
* **Which states have the most school projects?**
* * *Finding:* California and Texas lead with the highest number of participating schools.
* **Which states have the highest average donation amount?**
    * *Finding:* Wyoming and Hawaii have the highest average donations, suggesting a more engaged donor base per project.
* **What is the relationship between the number of projects and total donations?**
    * *Finding:* There is a strong positive correlation, indicating that states with more projects tend to attract more donations overall.
* **How long does it take for projects to get fully funded?**
    * *Finding:* The average funding time is approximately 32 days, with states like Hawaii and Wyoming funding projects faster than average.

## Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation, cleaning, and merging.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib & Plotly/Cufflinks:** For data visualization and creating interactive charts.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For the analysis environment.
